Ingredients:
60ml of whiskey
Tonic water
Large ice cubes. Do not use small cubes that melt quickly and spoil the cocktail
A slice of lime or lemon. I prefer lime but it's a matter of taste

Preparation method:
Put the large ice cubes in the glass
Serves 60ml of whiskey or about 4 fingers (5 if you like it strong, 6 if you want to wear it)
Serve mineral water to the brim
Embellish with a lime
Enjoy!
