Ingredients:
2 ounces of tequila
1 ounce of agave nectar
1 ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice
2 ounces of mineral water
4 mint leaves.

Preparing Method:
Cut the lemon, reserve a slice for garnish and squeeze the rest to extract the juice.

Place the mint leaves, agave nectar and lime juice in a Collins glass and crush these ingredients in the bottom of the glass with a cocktail pestle or the back of a spoon.

Fill the glass with ice cubes and add the tequila and sparkling water or soda.

Stir a little to mix and garnish with the lemon wedge and mint leaves.
