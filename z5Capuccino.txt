INGREDIENTS
1 cup of sweetened black espresso to your liking (or decaf if you prefer)
Cocoa powder to decorate
1 cup whole milk

Process:
To start we put the milk in a jar with a lid or in an airtight container. 
We cover well and shake vigorously for 30 seconds to a minute until the milk foams quite a lot and increases its size a lot.
That is the quick resource but you can do this process in a blender for 2 min and the result will be even more foamy.
Immediately put the already whipped milk in the microwave for about 30 seconds and thus the foam is compacted. 
If you used an airtight container or jar, use that for the microwave as well.
We first put this thick milk foam in the serving cup and carefully pour the sweetened coffee on the side. 
In this way the coffee goes down and the foam stays up. Decorate by sprinkling with cocoa powder and serve immediately, very hot.
Enjoy your Capuccino!
