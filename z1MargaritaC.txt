Ingredients
2 ounces of white tequila
1 ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice
1 ounce of Cointreau
salt to decorate the rim

Preparation Method:
Cut the lemon, reserve a slice for garnish and squeeze to extract the juice. 
Moisten the rim of an old-fashioned glass with the lemon juice and, holding it upside down, dip the rim into a flat dish filled with table salt or kosher salt.
Place the tequila, Cointreau, and lime juice in a cocktail shaker filled with ice, shake vigorously, and strain the drink into a decorated glass filled with ice cubes.
Enjoy!!
