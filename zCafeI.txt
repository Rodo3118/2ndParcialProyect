Ingredients:
1 glass of whiskey (preferably Irish)
1/2 liter of coffee
200 grams of liquid cream (milk cream)
40 grams of sugar

Preparation Method:

Heat the whiskey with sugar and wait until it boils.
Divide the mixture into 4 glasses.
Pour hot coffee on top. Have it ready in advance.
Assemble the milk cream. Once ready, you can put it in a pastry bag or use it like this.
Cover the glasses with the cream. Enjoy this drink without stirring, so the cream will remain on the surface
